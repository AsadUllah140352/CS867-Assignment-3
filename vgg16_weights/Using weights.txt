EXTRACTING THE FILE
1. Unzip the file in the folder using winrar or 7zip software.
2. A file will be extracted, named "vgg16_2.h5" - This is the weights file.

USING THE FILE IN CODE
1. Now, to use these weights in your code, after the model has been compiled, we usually train the model.

2. However, we can bypass the training now and just load these weights instead of training, since the model has already 
   been trained.

3. We use the model.load_weights("vgg16_weights.h5") commands, and we will get the same results as of the training model.
